# Information-Theoretic Methods & Monte Carlo Simulation in Finance

## 📌 Internship Overview
This repository contains the quantitative finance models and research developed during my internship at **IIT Indore**. The project focuses on financial modeling using **Monte Carlo simulations** and applying **Information Theory** (Entropy) to analyze market uncertainty.

## 🚀 Key Modules Implemented

### 1. Financial Simulation & Stochastic Processes
* **Geometric Brownian Motion (GBM):** Simulated random price paths for financial assets.
* **Volatility Analysis:** Computed historical volatility and covariance matrices.
* **Risk Metrics:** Calculated **Value-at-Risk (VaR)** to estimate potential portfolio losses.

### 2. Derivative Pricing (Options)
* **Monte Carlo Pricing:** Implemented algorithms to price **European Call and Put options**.
* **Black-Scholes Model:** Compared simulation results with the theoretical Black-Scholes formula.
* **Variance Reduction:** Used **Antithetic Sampling** to improve simulation accuracy and speed.

### 3. Information Theory in Finance
* **Market Entropy:** Applied **Shannon Entropy** and **Rényi Entropy** to measure the randomness of return distributions.
* **Divergence Analysis:** Used **Kullback-Leibler (KL) Divergence** to compare empirical market returns against normal distributions.

## 🛠️ Tech Stack
* **Languages:** Python
* **Libraries:** `NumPy`, `Pandas` (Data Manipulation), `Matplotlib` (Visualization), `SciPy` (Statistical Analysis), `yfinance` (Real-time Data).
